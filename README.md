# GiPStech Mobile Development Kit Example Applications

Here you will find a variety of sample apps demonstrating how to use the GiPStech MDK.

These sample applications are not intended to be compiled or executed as-is, since the GiPStech Development Key has not been provided.
The key can be requested by contacting GiPStech through the official website: [www.gipstech.com](https://www.gipstech.com).

The Development Key is uniquely associated with your specific application and is validated based on the application identifier:

-	the package name on Android
-	the bundle identifier on iOS

As such, these samples are provided exclusively for reference purposes, to illustrate how to correctly integrate the GiPStech MDK into your own project.

Three separate sample applications are included, each targeting a different integration scenario:

1. A Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) app - demonstrating cross-platform usage.
2. A pure Android app - using native Android components only.
3. A Swift-based iOS app - using native Swift and UIKit.

These examples serve as practical starting points for integrating the MDK into your specific development environment.
